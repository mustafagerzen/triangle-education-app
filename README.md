# Triangle Education App

An interactive geometry playground with an AI Tutor.
Built with **Flask (Python)** and **HTML5 Canvas**.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

Since this app uses a Python backend for the AI Tutor logic, it cannot be hosted on GitHub Pages (which only supports static sites). You must run it on a machine with Python installed.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mustafagerzen/triangle-education-app.git
cd triangle-education-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed. Then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the App
```bash
python main.py
```
*Note: On some systems, you might need to use `python3` instead of `python`.*

### 4. Open in Browser
Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🌐 Deploying to the Web
To share this as a website link (like `myapp.com`), you cannot use GitHub Pages. You need a platform that supports Python, such as:
- **Render** (Free tier available)
- **PythonAnywhere**
- **Heroku**
- **Vercel** (requires configuration)
